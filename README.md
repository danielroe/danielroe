## Hi all! ðŸ‘‹

I lead the [**Nuxt core team**](https://nuxt.com). I'm also a core team member of [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/) and a [**@vuejs**](https://github.com/vuejs) community partner. You can also see me at work across the [**@unjs ecosystem**](https://github.com/unjs) and further afield.

I have written a number of libraries that make use of type inference to improve developer experience, such as [**magic-regexp**](https://github.com/danielroe/magic-regexp), [**typed-vuex**](https://github.com/danielroe/typed-vuex/) and [**sanity-typed-queries**](https://github.com/danielroe/sanity-typed-queries).

I am also a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies and a Google GDE in Web Performance.
